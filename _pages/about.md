Since August 15th, 2024 I have been working as a **Data Scientist** at the **International Air Transport Association** (IATA, Geneva Office). At IATA, I am designing and implementing cross-divisional data science and machine learning solutions that drive business value across IATA’s global aviation network. I am collaborating with data architects and engineering teams to develop advanced models and algorithms that tackle complex business challenges. I am leading initiatives in data collection, transformation, and analysis, while recommending improvements to our data environments and submission standards. Additionally, I serve as IATA's main representative at the European AI Office in drafting the first General-Purpose AI Code of Practice, and I contribute actively to IATA’s Artificial Intelligence Technical Board.

Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist in the Medical Algos and Data (MAD) team at Natural Cycles (Geneva, Switzerland) from March 2023 to May 2024. Before joining NC, I worked as a Researcher/Data Scientist at the University of Geneva & University Hospital of Bern since the 1st of June & July 2021, respectively. I hold a **Ph.D.** in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), a **M.Sc.** in Neuroscience from the University of Geneva, and a **Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering**, equivalent to an M.Eng., from the National Technical University of Athens.

## Expertise

I am particularly motivated and passionate about data science, machine learning, AI, biomedical/electrical engineering, computational modeling and more generally about data analysis. I have been awarded the Summa Cum Laude Merit Award & Best Poster Award for my research (see LinkedIn profile). I am expert in many fields of DS including hypothesis testing, statistics, classification, regression, clustering, and timeseries forecasting.

I am an engineer experienced with gathering, cleaning, and organizing data for use by technical and non-technical personnel. I have a deep understanding of machine learning, statistical learning, and other analytical techniques. I am highly organized, motivated and diligent with significant background in electrical & computer engineering, and data science. I am proficient in Python & MATLAB. I also use R for statistical/hypothesis testing. I am motivated and passionate about data analysis (engineering & computational modeling) and more generally data science.

**I rank [12 all-time respondent for Machine Learning on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/machine-learning/topusers).**


**Main skills**: Data Preparation, Analysis & Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics & Probability, Signal Processing, Network science, and Graph theory.

**Interpersonal skills**: Teamwork, Critical thinking, Creativity, Communication & Scientific Report Writing, and Supervision.
