Currently, I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva & University Hospital of Bern since the 1st of June & July 2021, respectively. I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), a M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the University of Geneva, and a Diploma, equivalent to M.Eng., in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens.

I am experienced with gathering, cleaning, and organizing data for use by technical and non-technical personnel. I have a deep understanding of machine learning, statistical learning, algebraic, and other analytical techniques. I am highly organized, motivated and diligent with significant background in electrical & computer engineering, neuroscience, and data science. I am proficient in Python & MATLAB.

I am motivated and passionate about brain research (biomedical engineering & computational neuroscience) and more generally about data science. I have been awarded the Summa Cum Laude Merit Award & Best Poster Award for my research.

Some of my main skills include:
- fMRI analysis, Connectomics, Data Preparation, Analysis & Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics & Probability, Network science and Graph theory.

My interpersonal skills include:
- Teamwork, Critical thinking, Creativity, Communication & Scientific Report Writing as well as Supervision.
