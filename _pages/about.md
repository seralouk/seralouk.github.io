Since March 1st, 2023 I work as a Data Scientist in the MAD team (Medical Algos and Data) at Natural Cycles (Geneva, Switzerland).

Before joining NC, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva & University Hospital of Bern since the 1st of June & July 2021, respectively. I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), an M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the University of Geneva, and a Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering, equivalent to an M.Eng., from the National Technical University of Athens.

I am particularly motivated and passionate about research (biomedical/electrical engineering, computational modeling) and more generally about data science. I have been awarded the Summa Cum Laude Merit Award & Best Poster Award for my research.

I am an engineer experienced with gathering, cleaning, and organizing data for use by technical and non-technical personnel. I have a deep understanding of machine learning, statistical learning, and other analytical techniques. I am highly organized, motivated and diligent with significant background in electrical & computer engineering, and data science. I am proficient in Python & MATLAB. I also use R for statistical/hypothesis testing. I am motivated and passionate about data analysis (engineering & computational modeling) and more generally data science.
