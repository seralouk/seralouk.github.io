Since March 1st, 2023 I have been working as a **Data Scientist** in the Medical Algos and Data (MAD) tema at Natural Cycles (Geneva, Switzerland).

Before joining NC, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva & University Hospital of Bern since the 1st of June & July 2021, respectively. I hold a **Ph.D.** in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), an **M.Sc.** in Neuroscience from the University of Geneva, and a **Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering**, equivalent to an M.Eng., from the National Technical University of Athens.

## Expertise

I am particularly motivated and passionate about data science, machine learning, AI, biomedical/electrical engineering, computational modeling and more generally about data analysis. I have been awarded the Summa Cum Laude Merit Award & Best Poster Award for my research (see LinkedIn profile).

I am an engineer experienced with gathering, cleaning, and organizing data for use by technical and non-technical personnel. I have a deep understanding of machine learning, statistical learning, and other analytical techniques. I am highly organized, motivated and diligent with significant background in electrical & computer engineering, and data science. I am proficient in Python & MATLAB. I also use R for statistical/hypothesis testing. I am motivated and passionate about data analysis (engineering & computational modeling) and more generally data science.


**Main skills**: Data Preparation, Analysis & Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistics & Probability, Signal Processing, Network science, and Graph theory.

**Interpersonal skills**: Teamwork, Critical thinking, Creativity, Communication & Scientific Report Writing, and Supervision.
